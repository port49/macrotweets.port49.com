This is the You Insensitive Clod file.

Q) Why did you bother creating this, YIC?
A) Because some times I feel like jotting something down in a public space, but I'm not in a restroom.  Twitter gives me room to be a public nussaince, but sometimes I need more room to express the full range of being a jackass.  I don't like limits, so I don't give myself any.

Q) You really don't have any limits on text size, YIC?
A) Of course I do.  I just lied to you.  Because I don't want to limit myself to truth-speaking.  Post length is limited.  To something much greater than 140 characters.

Q) How much greater, YIC?
A) MUCH much.

Q) Why do I have to pay using PayPal, YIC?
A) Benjamin Franklin once quipped, "Those who would sacrifice money for convenience, deserve neither."
